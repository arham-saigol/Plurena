1. Core Rules

- Add packages with an install command. Do not edit package.json manually.
- Run the project's check, format, and lint commands after each change. If the project lacks them, suggest adding them.
- Avoid explicit return types unless they add real value.
- Treat 'as any' as a last resort. Use real type safety and rely on type inference where possible.
- Put performance first. When two options are sound, choose the one that makes the app feel fastest.
- Use good defaults and keep setup to a minimum. Users should get value with no setup.
- Never trade security for ease of use.

2. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

3. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

4. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

5. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

6. Development Stage

This project is still in active development.

- Do not add data backfills, migrations, old data support, or compatibility code unless the user asks for it.
- Do not preserve weak code or design choices just because they already exist.
- You may propose large changes or refactors when they would make the project simpler, faster, safer, or easier to maintain.
- Explain the reason, scope, and tradeoffs before making a large change.
- Prefer fixing the root cause over adding code that works around it.

This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.
