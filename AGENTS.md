When working in typescript:

- when adding a package to a project add it with an install command, instead of manually editing the package json
- run check/format/lint commands when your done making a change. if they don't exist, suggest making them for the project you're in
- avoid explicit return types unless absolutely needed
- `as any` should be an absolute last resort. always use real type safety. lean on type inference instead of manually writing new types over and over again

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.
